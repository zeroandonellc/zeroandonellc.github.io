<!--
Please develop a draft of your Hobby HTML page, as we discussed in class. Hobby page can be about any topic that you like or have been involved in, such as sports, travel, reading, cooking, video games, photography, music, etc.

We will have a midterm on HTML and CSS on March 2, so study this week, while you practice HTML and CSS in your draft Hobby project.

For the test at a minimum you will need to know HTML tags: BODY, H1, H2, H3, DIV, P, BR, B, I, IMG, A, SPAN.
Also how to assign an ID to a paragraph or DIV container, how to assign CLASS to same container.
Please make sure you know CSS attributes as follows: color, font-size, background-color, background-image, background-repeat,
margin, padding, border-style, border-width, border-color, float, width, height.

Again, please practice these CSS attributes in your Hobby.html draft page that you work on this week.
This is the best review for the midterm, applying these and other CSS attributes to your page.

Use W3Schools HTML and CSS tutorials if needed. Search for W3Schools in Google.
